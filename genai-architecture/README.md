# GenAI-Language-Teaching-Assistant-2025


### Functional Requirements

The company aims to develop a Japanese language teaching app for students and teachers. The app will focus on providing interactive lessons, progress tracking, and community features to enhance the learning experience. The company wants to ensure the app is accessible, engaging, and scalable, with a strong emphasis on data privacy and cultural sensitivity.

## The app will include:

<b>For Students</b>: User profiles, interactive lessons with multimedia, progress tracking, practice tools (flashcards, speaking, and writing), gamification, community features, and offline access.

<b>For Teachers</b>: Class management, content creation tools, assessment features, communication tools, and access to a resource library.

The company is willing to invest in robust infrastructure to ensure data privacy and avoid reliance on third-party managed services, which may increase costs over time.

### Assumptions
<b>Target Audience:</b> The app will cater to students of all proficiency levels (beginner to advanced) and teachers (both native and non-native Japanese speakers).

<b>Technology:</b> The app will be available on iOS and Android, leveraging AI for voice recognition and writing practice.

<b>Content:</b> The curriculum will align with JLPT levels and include culturally relevant, real-life scenarios.

<b>User Engagement:</b> Gamification and community features will drive engagement, with regular updates to maintain user interest.

### Infrastructure
The company will invest in scalable, cloud-based infrastructure to support growth and ensure data security.

### Data Strategy
The company is concerned about using copyrighted materials in the app. To address this:

All teaching materials will be either created in-house or purchased from licensed providers.

A centralized database will store all materials, ensuring easy access and compliance with copyright laws.

### Considerations
Localization: The app will support multiple languages for instructions and help sections to cater to non-English speakers. Content will be culturally sensitive and inclusive.

Accessibility: The app will be designed to accommodate users with disabilities, including screen reader compatibility and adjustable text sizes.

Data Privacy: Robust data privacy measures will be implemented, especially for minors, with compliance to GDPR and other relevant regulations.

Scalability: The app will be designed to handle a growing user base and content library without performance issues.

Feedback Mechanism: Regular user feedback will be collected to improve the app, and beta testing will be conducted before the full launch.

Monetization: A freemium model will be adopted, with basic features free and premium features (e.g., advanced lessons, personalized coaching) available via subscription or in-app purchases.

Open-Source Model Consideration
The company is considering using Mistal AI or Claude an open-source model with traceable training data, to avoid copyright issues and ensure transparency in the AI components of the app.
